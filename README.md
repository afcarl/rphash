Scalable Big Data Clustering by Random Projection Hashing.  This project is developing techniques for high-dimensional data clustering using random projections and locality sensitive hashing.  The approach is easily parallelized and has support for clustering across distributed data sets.  One of the strengths of this approach is that the clustering across distributed data sets is secure and does not require the exchange of any of the high-dimensional data.
